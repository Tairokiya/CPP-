## 1. String

(a)What is the output?

```C++
in constructor,nCharArray=0   
  // string s1 =  NULL
  // Not create a char array in heap
in constructor,nCharArray=1   
  // string s2 =  "abc"
  // Create the 1st char array in heap
in constructor,nCharArray=1   
  // string s3 =  "abc", refernece to string s2
  // Not create a char array in heap
in oprator[],nCharArray=2	  
  // in order to copy the array, we create a char array in heap
  // therefore, char array count is 2
abc 	
pbc 
in operator=,nCharArray=2
  //For s1.str is a NULL pointer, we assign directly the copy of pointer in s2.str to s1.str
in operator=,nCharArray=1
  //
pbc
pbc
in destructor,nCharArray=1
in destructor,nCharArray=1
in destructor,nCharArray=0
```



(b)What does nCharArray stand for?
 Is it equal to the number of String objects?

```
No. 
nCharArray stands for the character arrays we alloc on heap.
Because we create objects using both shallow and deep copy,
nCharArray is not necessarily equal to the number of String objects.
```



(c)Why is the value of nCharArray less than the number of String objects?

```C++
/* According to (b) we know that nArrayChar is the number of CharArray on heap. Thus we read the code once again: */

String s1;  
// nArrayChar = 0
// s1 = NULL . No array is created on heap.

const char *p = "abc";
String s2(p); 
// nArrayChar = 1
// use copy constructor to create a copy on heap in case we want to modify it

String s3 = s2; // nArrayChar = 1(没有更新)
// use lazy constructor, we merely link s3.str to s2.str.
// lazy copy : copy when needed

s3[0] = 'p'; // nArrayChar = 2
// Detect that s3 is linked to s2.
// So we create a copy on heap to modify the string

```



(d)In class String, `str[0]` is the reference count, 
 whose maximum value is `255`. Where is the content of Stringobject?

```
From str[1]~end
```



(e)How can we know that two String objects share the same memory space?

```C++
	(s1.c_str()-1) == (s2.c_str()-1) 
    (s1.c_str()) == (s2.c_str()) 
      //&(s1.str[0]) == &(s2.str[0]) , Although this visit is prohibited
```
```C++
/*Firstly, we should explain what role str does in the object.
char* str;  [x] [o][o][o][o][o][o][o]
 x:counter of the link number
 o:actual character
It looks the way inode store a piece of data.
Therefore, to judge whether two String obj share the same memory space is equivalant to judge whether this equation holds:*/
```
